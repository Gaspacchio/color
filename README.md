## Introduction

This is a simple app to extract color from an image using a web service.

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
